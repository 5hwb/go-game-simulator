# Go Game Simulator

Simple React app that aims to simulate the Go board game. (Go is also known as Weiqi in Chinese, Igo in Japanese, and Baduk in Korean.)

Note: work in progress! For now, this is just an improved version of the [tic-tac-toe game from the React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## TODO

* Display message if result was a draw
* Redefine the calculateWinner() function to not be based on hardcoded values
